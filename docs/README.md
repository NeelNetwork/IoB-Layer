# IoB-Layer

### **IoB** is a Technology which operates as a Layer over wavesplatform and enables the so called Internet of Blockchains; Connecting all Digital Assets in a decentralized **nexus**.

Blockchain Community has been facing a big issue ever since altcoins appeared; Like the computers before the 1970s blockchains were not capable of independently communicating and it required centralized services like Exchanges to do it.
To solve this issue community members offered different solutions from atomic swaps to decentralized exchanges but neither of those were enough.


wavesplatform is one of the market leading blockchain platforms with High Scalability Powered by NG-Protocol, DEx infrastructure, Smart Contracts and much more ... !


IoB uses this advantages to solve the isolation issue; Tokenizing all crypto assets into one network and enabling all their features in one place.


> _This Document Gives an insight of how IoB will Work at its first full version(1.0); to find out how far we are, check the roadmap._

IoB is not a Blockchain Platform by it self, But it is a distributed Ledger that holds the tokenized assets in different IoB nodes to insure no individual can access the funds. It relies on PoS Consensus algorithm to determine how much a node will be involved in the process.

The idea is simple, This Layer holds a connection with many blockchains and understands their logic to tokenize different assets from one network to another in order to perform interledger transactions.
